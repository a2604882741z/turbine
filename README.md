This is a SPA project, It's created with corn concept of [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), It coded by ES6 Syntax and based on MVVM pattern.

# Features
- Mixed Javascript Syntax with HTML code, you can be able to describe the relationship between operational code and UI component.
- HTML View will automatically update after described data has been changed, so you don't have to care how to let update tags, because this process is in good hand with Turbine.
- Powerful directive support, all directives as like a hook marked a HTML tag with prefix `'t-'`, multiple default directives such as `'t-for'` for loop a dom from data, `'t-if'` for logic estimate, `'t-bind'` for binding attributes of HTML Tag, `'t-on'` for binding Events etc, these are effective to build complex logic and make things easier.
- The compatibility covered IE 8+, Firfox, Chrome, Edge etc. 
- It has only 33KB (after compress).
